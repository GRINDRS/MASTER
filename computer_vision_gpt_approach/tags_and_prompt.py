tags_and_prompt.py

This module defines a structured initial prompt and associated tag lists
for use with a vision-based classification task powered by OpenAI.

The goal is to provide a clear and consistent set of visual descriptors
(taggable features) for well-known artworks or objects, which an AI model
can use to compare against visual elements detected in user-supplied images.

Each artwork or object is associated with a rich list of descriptive tags,
enabling reliable matching only when five or more tags overlap with those
detected in an image.

Usage: Used as a reference bank for visual recognition AI prompts.

# Initial prompt sent to OpenAI's vision model to instruct matching behaviour
initial_prompt = """
You are a visual tag-based identifier. Below is a list of artworks and objects along with their associated tags.

Your task:
- When I send you an image frame, use only the visual features (tags) from that image to compare against the tags below.
- Return ONLY the name of the artwork or object that best matches the tags from the image.
- You must only return a match if AT LEAST 5 tags from the image are found in that artwork's tag list.
- If no artwork has at least 5 matching tags, reply: "nothing found".
